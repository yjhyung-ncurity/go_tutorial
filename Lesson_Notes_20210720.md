### Slice Range Syntax
- example: sample['a','b','c','d'] 
    - sample[start_index_inclusive : up_to_index_not_inclusive]
    - sample[0:2] 
        - starts from 0 index which is 'a' and ends before 2 index which is 'c'
        - returns 'a', 'b' only
    - sample[1:3]
        - starts from 1 index which is 'b' and ends before 3 index which is 'd'
        - returns 'b','c'
    - sample[:3]
        - starts from the beginning index which is 'a' and ends before 2 index which is 'd'
        - returns 'a','b','c'
    - sample[2:]
        - starts from 2 index which is 'c' and ends at the last index which is 'd'
        - returns 'c' , 'd'


### Byte Slice
 - List of bytes that represent UTF-8 encodings of Unicode Code points (See: ASCII TABLE Site)
 - ex) bs := []byte{71, 111} 
       fmt.Printf("%s", bs)
       %s converts byte slice to string 

### Byte Slice Type Conversion
 - Use []byte()
 - ex) greeting := "Hi There!" 
       fmt.Println([]byte(greeting))

### IO/IOUTIL PACKAGE - WriteFile function (saving files to the hard drive)
 - As an example, created saveToFile function which includes the following:
    - receiver of a deck type (custom type)
    - argument of a filename (input parameter)
    - return type of error (error message)

 - ioutil.WriteFile(filename, []byte(d.toString()), 0666) 
    - writeFile arguments checkout golang/pkg/ioutil@go1.16.6#WriteFile

### Random Value 
 - rand.Intn : Pseudo Random Generator (Seed value is the set of values which needs to be generated by generator. Pseu Generator always uses the same seed to generate random number)
 - that's why it always provides the same random value 
 - How to create random numbers each time?
    - provide random seed numbers each time by using type Rand


### Testing with Go 
 - To make a test file, create a new file and name has to ends in _test.go (ex. testing main file. => main_test.go)
 - To run test, use `go test` command
 - Excercise #1 : new deck function by using if statement and errorf in TestNewDeck() to test the following :
    - To make sure deck is created with x number of cards (ex. 4 suits, 4 numbers = total of 16 cards)
    - To make sure the first card is an Ace of Spades
    - To make sure that the last card is Four of Clubs 

 - Excercise #2 : save to file function and new deck from file function by using if statement and errorf in TestSaveToDeckAndNewDeckFromFile() to test the following :
    - To make sure if there is any crashed files
    - Use Remove() within os package provided by Go to remove any of the unnecessary / crashed files (ex. _decktesting)
    - Create a new deck and save it to a file by using SaveToFile function (ex. _decktesting)
    - Load the file by using NewDeckFromFile function (ex. _decktesting)
    - Make sure if the length of newly loaded file matches x number of cards (total of 16). if not return error message
    - Final step use Remove() again to remove files (ex. _decktesting)
